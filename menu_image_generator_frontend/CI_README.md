# CI Helper: Running Flutter commands

Always run Flutter commands from within this app directory:

cd menu-image-generator-182975-182984/menu_image_generator_frontend
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run

Running these commands from the repository root will cause:
"Error: Could not determine project root directory for Flutter project"

Refer to README.md in this same directory for more details.
